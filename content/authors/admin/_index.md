नमस्ते! I am Harsh Kumar, but I also have a Chinese name, which is 哈石. In my native language, which is Hindi my name is written as हर्ष. I am the founder of [Fibzio OÜ](https://fibzio.com) a tech STARTUP based out of Estonia where we implement innovative solutions in the field of Finance, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence & IoT at dozen different companies across Asia and Europe. 

My bachelor is from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) in Computer Engineering, As part of the [PoliTong project](https://www.polito.it/international/offerta/percorsi/politong/index.php?lang=en), I’ve spent one year at [Tongji University (同济大学)](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai.

I am Indian but I am also familiar with both Italian and Chinese cultures & languages since I lived in Italy during my bachelor's degree and in China during my exchange year. Currently I’m living in Turin will soon move to China to resume my dual degree. You can call me a global citizen, and that’s something I definitely like. 

Curiosity is something that drives me towards my goals and something that helps me find my path in life, which is like a needle in a haystack. I love Computer Science and technology in general and love exploring the field, I am an entreprenur by nature and love to explore new domains.

I am always looking forward to new challenges, so if you have any… don’t hesitate to contact me!
